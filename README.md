# Boxxduino
Boxxduino is an open source Boxx-style Nintendo Switch Controller

The code is based on Colpasus' UnoSmashbox project. See (https://github.com/colpasus/UnoSmashbox)  
This project also uses the Unojoy hex file created by AlanCatham.

Compared to the UnoSmashbox project, a Boxx controller style layout is used. 
For tilt inputs, a x-modifier and y-modifier buttons are created to adjust the values for the stick tilk.
4 buttons are used to create a C-stick/R-stick inputs, which are not present in the UnoSmashbox project.
